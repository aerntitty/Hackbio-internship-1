    "\n",
    "This **Feature Correlation Heatmap** visually represents how different molecular descriptors are correlated with each other. Correlation values range from **-1 to 1**, where:  \n",
    "- **1 (Red)**: Strong positive correlation (when one feature increases, the other also increases).  \n",
    "- **0 (White/Neutral)**: No correlation.  \n",
    "- **-1 (Blue)**: Strong negative correlation (when one feature increases, the other decreases).  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Observations from the Heatmap**  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Highly Correlated Features (Strong Positive Correlations)**\n",
    "   - **MW (Molecular Weight) is strongly correlated with:**\n",
    "     - **AtomCount (0.97)** and **BondCount (0.96)** â†’ Heavier molecules generally have more atoms and bonds.  \n",
    "     - **HAC (Heavy Atom Count) (0.98)** â†’ This makes sense as more heavy atoms increase molecular weight.  \n",
    "     - **RO3_COUNT (0.79)** and **LIPINSKI_COUNT (0.34)** â†’ Larger molecules tend to have more rule-of-three violations and Lipinski rule violations.  \n",
    "   - **HBA (Hydrogen Bond Acceptors) & HBD (Hydrogen Bond Donors) are strongly correlated (0.46)** â†’ Molecules with more acceptor sites tend to have more donor sites.  \n",
    "   - **TPSA_NO & TPSA_NOPS (0.95)** â†’ Both are measures of polar surface area, so their strong correlation is expected.  \n",
    "   - **AromaticRingCount & SimpleRingCount (0.89)** â†’ More aromatic rings contribute to overall ring count.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Negative Correlations**\n",
    "   - **TPSA_NO & XLogP (-0.36)** â†’ Molecules with a high polar surface area tend to have lower lipophilicity. This aligns with the expectation that highly polar molecules are less lipophilic.  \n",
    "   - **FSP3 & AromaticRingCount (-0.34)** â†’ Higher FSP3 (sp3 hybridization) means the molecule is more aliphatic, reducing the number of aromatic rings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Score vs. Molecular Features**\n",
    "   - **The \"score\" row shows relatively weak correlations with most descriptors**, suggesting that the target or model score does not strongly depend on a single feature but may be influenced by multiple factors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How to Interpret This?**\n",
    "- **Larger molecules (high MW, AtomCount, HAC) tend to have more bonds, a higher number of acceptors/donors, and more rule violations.**  \n",
    "- **Lipophilicity (XLogP) is inversely related to polar surface area (TPSA_NO), meaning hydrophobic molecules tend to have lower polarity.**  \n",
    "- **Aromaticity and flexibility (FSP3) are negatively correlated, showing a trade-off between aromatic and non-aromatic structures.**  \n"
